                <h2>SEO Techniques</h2>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Target Specific Keywords</li></h3>
                    <p>Researching the right keywords for a webpage can be 
                        useful as they can lead the viewers to the webpage
                        in little time. By thinking about what words or phrases
                        that viewers will use when searching for the webpage, 
                        the webpage will be easy to find and clicked on more 
                        often. The web designer can know what words to use 
                        to lead viewers to their webpage by researching what 
                        words are frequently entered in the search bar and 
                        their rankings. But the words must be related to 
                        the content of the webpage to be searched easily (Moz, n.d.).
                    </p>
                    <h3><li>Design Search Appearance</li></h3>
                    <p>Designing a good search appearance is important for a 
                        web designer if they want viewers to click on their 
                        webpage. In addition to looking for key words of what 
                        the viewer is trying to research, they will look at the 
                        appearance of the search results and choose the one that 
                        appeals to them the most. Some factors that may influence 
                        this decision include: favicons, breadcrumbs, title,
                        description, and rich results. Enhancing these elements 
                        are the key to designing a good search appearance that will 
                        sway the viewers into clicking the designer's webpage (Moz, n.d.).
                    </p>
                    <h3><li>Create Quality Content</li></h3>
                    <p>Creating high quality content on a webpage is necessary 
                        for introducing a high volume of viewers to the webpage.
                        This involves having close to or exactly the information
                        that viewers wish to see. Also, the information must be laid
                        out in a way that is easy to understand and absorb. This can 
                        be done by having a well structured webpage with information
                        that is clearly pointed out with headers. The designer can also 
                        use images to provide visual meanings of the information to the 
                        viewer. Ensuring the website is neat with updated information will
                        make it quick for the search engine and viewer to navigate to the 
                        webpage (Moz, n.d.).
                    </p>

                <h2>SMO Techniques</h2>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Create Shareable Content</li></h3>
                    <p>By creating content that viewers will like and enjoy, it will become 
                        popular overtime. Having content that the viewers can express their 
                        interest towards will influence them to share it with their friends
                        and families. This is how more social relationships become developed
                        when they have content that they relate to and talk about. 
                        This will boost the social platform's popularity as the 
                        origin of the popular content being shared to many viewers (Bhargava, 2010).
                    </p>
                    <h3><li>Share Content Easily</li></h3>
                    <p>Sharing content must be made easily in order to boost a social
                        platform's reputation and market share over the social media
                        industry. Viewers must have the option to be able to share content 
                        with the touch of a button rather than tagging or bookmarking it.
                        Some workarounds to these limited options can be to have a share 
                        button that lets one select the people they want to relay it to
                        or adding a link to the content to their profiles for people to 
                        click and view it. Sharing content easily will increase viewers' 
                        satisfaction and promote social platform's operations (Bhargava, 2010).
                    </p>
                    <h3><li>Encourage Free Mashup</li></h3>
                    <p>Encouraging the mashup is important because it keeps the content 
                        alive and heard to many viewers. This would promote viewer engagement,
                        creativity, and wide content distribution to different social platforms.
                        If viewers are able to freely remix the content and turn it into their 
                        own, it will give them a sense of ownership and a personal connection to it. 
                        This would increase the chances of them sharing it to others and creating
                        exposure to the original content. In addition, mashups introduce an inclusive
                        environment where everyone's opinions are heard and this can provide feedback 
                        on the viewers' perspective towards the content (Bhargava, 2010).</p>
